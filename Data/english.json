I always assist my parents in doing the dish after meals. I also water the flowers in the yard and tidying up my own bedroom whatever necessary. In my opinion, students can benefit a lot doing some housework. Firstly, doing housework was helpful for us to be a responsible person. Also, it gives our parents more time to do what they are like and it improves the family relationship. What’s most, doing housework can be a form of mentally relaxation from study. That’s our view on housework. And hopes this can inspire more thinking on the topic!",

For some , an animal  \nprovides  more  comfort  than a husband/wife . A 2002  study  by Karen  Allen  of the State  \nUniversity  of New  York  measured  stress（紧张） levels  and blood  pressure  in people  \n--- half of them  pet owners  --- while  they performed  5 minutes  of mental  arithmetic （\n算术） or held a hand  in ice water . Subjects  completed  the tasks  alone , with a \nhusband/wife , a close  friend  or with a pet. People  with pets did it best.

        "instruction": "C \nThousands  of people  living  in the Chinese  capital  will celebrate  the start of the \nChinese  New  year by heading  for the ski resorts（滑雪场） . Never  mind  that \nBeijing ’s dry weather  seldom  produces  snow . It is cold enough  in winter  for snow  --- \nmaking  machines  to make  a covering  for the hills north  to the capital . And the rapid  \ngrowth  of a pleasure  --- seeking  middle  class  has formed  the basis  for this new craze\n（热潮） .  \nSince  Beijing ’s first ski resort  was opened  ten years  ago, the sport  has enjoyed  \nastonishing  increase . There  are now more  than a dozen  resorts . Clothes  markets  in the \ncity have  added  bright  colored  ski suits to their winter  collections . Mr. Wei, a \nmanager  of a newly -opened  ski resort  in Beijing , sees the growth  of an industry  that \ncould  soon  lead Chinese  to head  for the ski resorts  of Europe . In recent  years  ski \nresorts  offering  natural  snow  have  opened  in China . But many  are in faraway  areas  of \nthe country  and can’t really  match  the equipment  and services  of some  ski resorts  in \nEurope .  \nBeijing ’s skiing  craze  is partly  a result  of the recent  increase  in private（私有的\n） cars. This has led to the growth  of a leisure  industry  in the capital ’s suburbs（郊区\n）, which  until the late-1990s  were  unreachable  to ordinary  people . According  to Mr.  \nWei, about  40% of the visitors  to his resort  come  in their own cars. The rest are bused  \nin by schools , businesses  or government  offices .  \nThe problem  is making  money . Starting  ski resorts  requires  quite  a lot of money ;  \nhiring  land from  the local  government , preparing  the hills, buying  snow  machines , \nmaking  sure there  are enough  water  and electricity  to run them , and buying  ski \nequipment  for hiring  out to customers .  \nThe ski resort  where  Mr. Wei works  cost nearly  $4m to set up. And as so often  in \nChina  when  someone  comes  up with a good  idea, many  others  hash in and price  wars  \nbreak  out. Beijing  now offers  some  of the cheapest  ski training  classes  in the world , \nthough  with most  people  rather  new to the sport , expecting  a few more  doing  the same  \n  job.  \n50. What  does this text mainly  talk about？　   　 \nA. Convenience  for skiers  brought  about  by private  cars.  \nB. Skiing  as a new way of enjoying  one’s spare  time.  \nC. Things  to be considered  when  starting  a ski resort .  \nD. A sudden  increase  of ski training  classes  in Beijing .  \n51. Why  are some  Chinese  likely  to go skiing  in Europe？　   　 \nA. To visit more  ski areas .              B. To ski on natural  snow .  \nC. For a large  collection  of ski suits.      D. For better  services  and equipment .  \n52. The underlined  words  “leisure  industry ” in Paragraph  3 refer  to　   　 \nA. transport  to ski resorts                \nB. production  of family  cars \nC. business  of providing  spare  time enjoyments  \nD part-time work  for people  living  in the suburbs  \n53.

I received  a letter  from  the \nhead  of the Personnel  Department  that started , “Dear  John , I am quite  pleased  that you \nhave  decided  to join us.” That “quite ” saddened  me. I thought  he was saying  “we’re \nkind of pleased  you decided  to join us although  I wish  we had hired  someone  else.” \nThen  I discovered  that in American  English  “quite ” sometimes  means  “very”, while  \nin British  English  it means  “fairly ”. \nSo the first lesson  about  working  in other  countries  is to learn  the language  and \nby that I don’t just mean  the words  people  speak . It is body  language , dress , manners , \nideas  and so on. The way people  do things  highlights  many  of the differences  we see \nbetween  cultures（文化） . \nSome  of these  differences  may be only on the surface  --- dress , food and hours  of \nwork  --- while  others  may be deeper  and take longer  to deal with. Mostly , it is just a \nquestion  of getting  used to the differences  and accepting  them , like the climate（气候\n）, while  getting  on with business . \nSome  of the differences  may be an improvement . People  are more  polite ; the \n  service  is better ; you ask for something  to be done  and it happens  without  having  to \nask again .

His name  was Mr. Basille.  He wore  a white  cap and \ndrove  a white  truck.  As a 5-year-old  boy, I couldn’t  take my eyes off the coin changer  \nfixed  to his belt. He noticed  this one day during  a delivery  and gave  me a quarter  out \nof his coin changer.  \nOf course,  he delivered  more  than milk.  There  was cheese,  eggs and so on. If we \nneeded  to change  our order,  my mother  would  pen a note- --“Please  add a bottle  of \nbuttermilk  next delivery”- --and place  it in the box along  with the empty  bottles.  And \nthen,  the buttermilk  would  magically  appear.  \nAll of this was about  more  than convenience.  There  existed  a close  relationship  \nbetween  families  and their milkmen.  Mr. Basille  even  had a key to out house,  for \nthose  times  when  it was so cold outside  that we put the box indoors,  so that the milk \nwouldn’t  freeze.  And I remember  Mr. Basille  from  time to time taking  a break  at our \nkitchen  table,  having  a cup of tea and telling  stories  about  his delivery.  \nThere  is sadly  no home  milk delivery  today.  Big companies  allowed  the \nproduction  of cheaper  milk,  thus making  it difficult  for milkmen  to compete.  Besides,  \nmilk is for sale everywhere,  and it may just not have  been  practical  to have  a delivery  \nservice.  \nRecently,  an old milk box in the countryside  I saw brought  back  my childhood  \nmemories.

However,  the only way for \nthem  to get that honey  is to find a wild bees’ nest and take the honey  from  it. Often,  \nthese  nests  are high up in trees,  and it is difficult  to find them.  In parts  of Africa,  \nthough,  people  and animals  looking  for honey  have  a strange  and unexpected  helper  \n--- a little bird called  a honey  guide.  \nThe honey  guide  does not actually  like honey,  but it does like the wax in the \nbeehives  (蜂房 ). The little bird cannot  reach  this wax,  which  is deep  inside  the bees’ \nnest. So, when  it finds  a suitable  nest, it looks  for someone  to help it. The honey  guide  \ngives  a loud cry that attracts  the attention  of both passing  animals  and people.  Once  it \nhas their attention,  it flies through  the forest,  waiting  from  time to time for the curious  \nanimal  or person  as it leads  them  to the nest. When  they finally  arrive  at the nest, the \nfollower  reaches  in to get at the delicious  honey  as the bird patiently  waits  and \nwatches.  Some  of the honey,  and the wax,  always  falls to the ground,  and this is when  \nthe honey  guide  takes  its share.  \nScientists  do not know  why the honey  guide  likes  eating  the wax,  but it is very \ndetermined  in its efforts  to get it. The birds  seem  to be able to smell  wax from  a long \ndistance  away.  They  will quickly  arrive  whenever  a beekeeper  is taking  honey  from  \nhis beehives,  and will even  enter  churches  when  beeswax  candles  are being  lit. \n60. Why  is it difficult  to find a wild bees’ nest?  \nA. It’s small  in size.        B. It’s hidden  in trees.  \nC. It’s covered  with wax.     D. It’s hard to recognize.  \n61.

A man who has not had a \nchance  to go swimming  for years  can still swim  as well as ever when  he gets back  in \nthe water.  He can get on a bicycle  after many  years  and still ride away.  He can play \ncatch  and hit a ball as well as his son. A mother  who has not thought  about  the words  \nfor years  can teach  her daughter  the poem  that begins  “Twinkle,  twinkle,  little star” or \nremember  the story  of Cinderella  or Goldilocks  and the Three  Bears.  \nOne explanation  is the law of overlearning , which  can be stated  as follows:  Once  \nwe have  learned  something,  additional  learning  trials  increase  the length  of time we \nwill remember  it.                                 \nIn childhood  we usually  continue  to practice  such skills  as swimming,  bicycle  \nriding,  and playing  baseball  long after we have  learned  them.  We continue  to listen  to \nand remind  ourselves  of words  such as “Twinkle,  twinkle,  little star” and childhood  \ntales such as Cinderella  and Goldilocks.

By cramming,  a student  may learn  the subject  well enough  to get by on the \nexamination,  but he is likely  soon  to forget  almost  everything  he learned.

        "instruction": "A \nDoctor  are known  to be terrible  pilots.  They  don’t listen  because  they already  \nknow  it all. I was lucky:  I became  a pilot in 1970,  almost  ten years  before  I graduated  \nfrom  medical  school.  I didn’t realize  then,  but becoming  a pilot makes  me a better  \nsurgeon.  I loved  flying.  As I flew bigger,  faster  planes,  and in worse  weather.  I \nlearned  about  crew  resource  management  (机组资源管理 ), or CRM,  a new idea to \nmake  flying  safer.  It means  that crew  members  should  listen  and speak  up for a good  \nresult,  regardless  of positions.  \nI first read about  CRM  in 1980.  Not long after that, an attending  doctor  and I \nwere  flying  in bad weather.  The controller  had us turn too late to get our landing  \nready.  The attending  doctor  was flying;  I was safety  pilot He was so busy  because  of \nthe bad turn, he had forgotten  to put the landing  gear (起落架 ) down.  He was a better  \npilot --- and my boss --- so it felt unusual  to speak  up. But I had to: Our lives  were  in \ndanger.  I put aside  my uneasiness  and said, “We need  to put the landing  gear down  \nnow! ” That was my first real lesson  in the power  of CRM,  and I’ve used it in the \noperating  room  ever since.  \nCRM  requires  that the pilot/surgeon  encourage  others  to speak  up. It further  \nrequires  that when  opinions  are from  the opposite,  the doctor  doesn ’t overreact,  which  \nmight  prevent  fellow  doctors  from  voicing  opinions  again.  So when  I’m in the \noperating  room,  I ask for ideas  and help from  others.  Sometimes  they’re not willing  to \nspeak  up. But I hope  that if I continue  to encourage  them,  someday  someone  will keep  \nme from  “landing  gear up”. \n56. What  dose the author  say about  doctors  in general?  \nA. They  like flying  by themselves.     B. They  are unwilling  to take advice.  \nC. They  pretend  to be good  pilots.     D. They  are quick  learners  of CRM.  \n57.

        "instruction": "B \nPassenger  pigeons（ 旅 鸽 ） once  flew over much  of the United  States  in \nunbelievable  numbers.  Written  accounts  from  the 18th and 19th centuries  described  \nflocks（群） so large  that they darkened  the sky for hours.  \nIt was calculated  that when  its population  reach  its highest  point,  there  were  \nmore  than 3 billion  passenger  pigeons  – a number  equal  to 24 to 40 percent  of the \ntotal bird population  in the United  States,  making  it perhaps  the most  abundant  birds  \nin the world.  Even  as late as 1870  when  their numbers  had already  become  smaller,  a \nflock  believed  to be 1 mile wide  and 320 miles  (about  515 kilometers)  long was seen \nnear Cincinnati.  \nSadly,  the abundance  of passenger  pigeons  may have  been  their undoing . Where  \nthe birds  were  abundant,  people  believed  there  was an ever-lasting  supply  and killed  \nthem  by the thousands.  Commercial  hunters  attracted  them  to small  clearings  with \ngrain,  waited  until pigeons  had settled  to feed,  then threw  large  nets over them,  taking  \nhundreds  at a time.  The birds  were  shipped  to large  cities  and sold in restaurants.  \nBy the closing  decades  of the 19th century,  the hardwood  forests  where  \npassenger  pigeons  nested  had been  damaged  by Americans’  need  for wood,  which  \nscattered（驱散） the flocks  and forced  the birds  to go farther  north,  where  cold \ntemperatures  and spring  storms  contributed  to their decline.  Soon  the great  flocks  \nwere  gone,  never  to be seen again.  \nIn 1897,  the state of Michigan  passed  a law prohibiting  the killing  of passenger  \npigeons,  but by then,  no sizable  flocks  had been  seen in the state for 10 years.

I left for the land of warmth  and vitamin  C (维生素\nC), thinking  of beaches  and orange  trees.  When  we touched  down  to blue skies  and \nwarm  air, I sent up a small  prayer  of gratefulness.  Swimming  pools,  wine  tasting,  and \npink sunsets  (at normal  evening  hours,  not 4 in the afternoon)  filled  the weekend,  but \nthe best part — particularly  to my taste,  dulled  by months  of cold — weather  root \nvegetables  — was a 7 a.m. adventure  to the Sarasota  farmers’  market  that proved  to \nbe more  than worth  the early  wake-up  call. \nThe market,  which  was founded  in 1979,  sets up its tents  every  Saturday  from  7 \na.m. to 1 p.m.,  rain or shine,  along  North  Lemon  and State  streets.

But I homed  \nin, with uncertainty,  on one particular  table  at the Brown’s  Grove  Farm’s  stand,  full of \nfresh  and soft tomatoes  the size of my fist. These  were  the real deal — and at that \nmoment,  I realized  that the best part of Sarasota  in winter  was going  to be eating  \nthings  that back  home  in New  York  I wouldn’t  be experiencing  again  for months.  \nDelighted  as I was by the tomatoes  in sight,  my happiness  deepened  when  I \nlearned  that Brown’s  Grove  Farm  is one of the suppliers  for Jack Dusty,  a newly  \nopened  restaurant  at the Sarasota  Ritz Carlton,  where  — luckily  for me — I was \nplanning  to have  dinner  that very night.

This evening,  as on every  \n  Thursday  night,  psychologist  Maud  Lehanne  is leading  two of France’s  favorite  \npastimes,  coffee  drinking  and the “talking  cure”. Here  they are learning  to get in touch  \nwith their true feelings.  It isn’t always  easy.  The customers  — some  thirty  Parisians  \nwho pay just under  $2 (plus  drinks)  per session  — care quick  to intellectualize  (高谈\n阔论 ), slow  to open  up and connect.  “You are forbidden  to say ‘one feels’  or ‘people  \nthink’ ” Lehanne  told them.  “Say ‘I think,’  ‘Think  me’.”  \nA café society  where  no intellectualizing  is allowed?  It couldn’t  seem  more  \nun-French.  But Lehanne’s  psychology  café is about  more  than knowing  oneself:  It’s \ntrying  to help the city’s  troubled  neighborhood  cafes.  Over  the years,  Parisian  cafes  \nhave  fallen  victim  to changes  in the French  lifestyle  — longer  working  hours,  a fast \nfood boom  and a younger  generation’s  desire  to spend  more  time at home.  Dozens  of \nnew theme  cafes  appear  to change  the situation.  Cafes  focused  around  psychology,  \nhistory,  and engineering  are catching  on, filling  tables  well into the evening.  \nThe city’s  “psychology  cafes ”, which  offer  great  comfort,  are among  the most  \npopular  places.  Middle-aged  homemakers,  retirees,  and the unemployed  come  to such \ncafes  to talk about  love,  anger,  and dreams  with a psychologist.  And they come  to \nLehanne’s  group  just to learn  to say what  they feel. “There’s  a strong  need  in Paris  for \ncommunication, ” says Maurice  Frisch,  a café La Chope  regular  who works  as a \nreligious  instructor  in a nearby  church.  “People  have  few real friends.  And they need  \nto open  up”. Lehanne  says she’d  like to see psychology  cafes  all over France.  “If \npeople  had normal  lives,  these  cafes  wouldn’t  exist, ” she says.  “If life weren’t  a battle,  \npeople  wouldn’t  need  a special  place  just to speak. ” But then,  it wouldn’t  be France.    \n32. What  are people  encouraged  to do at the cafe La Chope?   \nA. Learn  a new subject.    B. Keep  in touch  with friends.   \nC. Show  off their knowledge.   D. Express  their true feelings.   \n33. How  are cafes  affected  by French  lifestyle  changes?   \nA. They  are less frequently  visited.   B. They  stay open  for longer  hours.   \nC. They  have  bigger  night  crowds.   D. They  start to serve  fast food.   \n34. What  are theme  cafes  expected  to do?  \nA. Create  more  jobs.    B. Supply  better  drinks.   \n  C. Save  the cafe business.   D. Serve  the neighborhood.   \n35. Why  are psychology  cafes  becoming  popular  in Paris?   \nA. They  bring  people  true friendship.    \nB. They  give people  spiritual  support.   \nC.

I was able to buy it a \nlittle over a year ago because  I had my relatives  give me money  for my birthday  \ninstead  of a lot of clothes  that wouldn’t  fit. I let a salesclerk  fool me into buying  a \ndiscontinued  model.  I realized  this a day late, when  I saw newspaper  advertisements  \nfor the set at seventy-five  dollars  less than I had paid.  The set worked  so beautifully  \nwhen  I first got it home  that I would  keep  it on until stations  signed  off for the night.  \nFortunately,  I didn’t  got any channels  showing  all-night  movies  or I would  never  have  \ngotten  to bed. \nThen  I started  developing  a problem  with the set that involved  static  (静电 ) \nnoise.  For some  reason,  when  certain  shows  switched  into a commercial,  a loud noise  \nwould  sound  for a few seconds.  Gradually,  this noise  began  to appear  during  a show,  \nand to get rid of it, I had to change  to another  channel  and then change  it back.  \nSometimes  this technique  would  not work,  and I had to pick up the set and shake  it to \nremove  the sound.  I actually  began  to build  up my arm muscles  (肌肉 ) shaking  my \nset. \nWhen  neither  of these  methods  removed  the static  noise,  I would  sit helplessly  \nand wait for the noise  to go away.  At last I ended  up hitting  the set with my fist, and it \nstopped  working  altogether.

Experts  say the way you design  \nyour home  could  play a role in whether  you pack  on the pounds  or keep  them  off. You \ncan make  your environment  work  for you instead  of against  you. Here  are some  ways  \nto turn your home  into part of diet plan.  \nOpen  the curtains  and turn up the lights.  Dark  environments  are more  likely  to \nencourage  overeating,  for people  are often  less self-conscious （难为情） when  \nthey’re  in poorly  lit places-and  so more  likely  to eat lots of food.  If your home  doesn’t  \nhave  enough  window  light,  get more  lamps  and flood  the place  with brightness.  \nMind  the colors.  Research  suggests  warm  colors  fuel our appetites.  In one study,  \npeople  who ate meals  in a blue room  consumed  33 percent  less than those  in a yellow  \nor red room.  Warm  colors  like yellow  make  food appear  more  appetizing,  while  cold \ncolors  make  us feel less hungry.  So when  it’s time to repaint,  go blue.  \nDon’t  forget  the clock—or the radio.  People  who eat slowly  tend to consume  \nabout  70 fewer  calories（卡路里） per meal  than those  who rush through  their meals.  \nBegin  keeping  track  of the time,  and try to make  dinner  last at least 30 minutes,  And \nwhile  you’re  at it, actually  sit down  to eat. If you need  some  help slowing  down,  turn \non relaxing  music.  It makes  you less likely  to rush through  a meal.  \nDownsize  the dishes,  Big serving  bowls  and plates  can easily  make  us fat. We \neat about  22 percent  more  when  using  a 12-inch  plate  instead  of a 10-inch  plate.  \n  When  we choose  a large  spoon  over a smaller  one ,total  intake（摄入）  jumps  by 14 \npercent.  And we’ll  pour about  30 percent  more  liquid  into a short,  wide  glass  than a \ntall, skinny  glass.  \n25.

Owain  James,  the president  of the National  Union  of \nStudents  (NUS),  argued  that the increase  is evidence  of student  had ship — young  \npeople  are being  forced  into earning  money  before  finishing  their education.  “New  \nstudents  are now aware  that they are likely  to leave  university  up to ￡15,000  in debt.  \nIt is not surprising  that more  and more  students  are taking  a gap year to earn money  to \nsupport  their study  for the degree.  NUS  statistics  show  that over 40% of students  are  \nforced  to work  during  term time and the figure  increases  to 90% during  vacation  \nperiods,”  he said. \n29. What  do we learn  about  the gap year from  the text?  \nA. It is flexible  in length.        B. It is a time for relaxation.  \nC. It is increasingly  popular.     D. It is required  by universities.  \n30. According  to Tony  Higgins,  students  taking  a gap year______.  \nA. are better  prepared  for college  studies  \nB. know  a lot more  about  their future  jobs \nC. are more  likely  to leave  university  in debt \nD. have  a better  chance  to enter  top universities  \n31. How  does Owain  James  feel about  the gap-year  phenomenon?  \nA. He’s puzzled.   B. He’s worried.   C. He’s surprised.   D. He’s annoyed.  \n32.

Only  after a year of friendly  discussion  \ndid Ms. Garza  finally  say yes. That was four years  ago. Today  all three  generations  \nregard  the move  as a success,  giving  them  a closer  relationship  than they would  have  \nhad in separate  cities.  \nNo statistics  show  the number  of grandparents  like Garza  who are moving  closer  \nto adult  children  and grandchildren.  Yet there  is evidence  suggesting  that the trend  is \n  growing.

        "instruction": "D \nThe meaning  of silence  varies  among  cultural  groups.  Silences  may be \nthoughtful,  or they may be empty  when  a person  has nothing  to say. A silence  in a \nconversation  may also show  stubbornness,  uneasiness,  or worry.  Silence  may be \nviewed  by some  cultural  groups  as extremely  uncomfortable;  therefore  attempts  may \nbe made  to fill every  gap (间隙 ) with conversation.  Persons  in other  cultural  groups  \nvalue  silence  and view  it as necessary  for understanding  a person’s  needs.   \nMany  Native  Americans  value  silence  and feel it is a basic  part of \ncommunicating  among  people,  just as some  traditional  Chinese  and Thai persons  do. \nTherefore,  when  a person  from  one of these  cultures  is speaking  and suddenly  stops,  \nwhat  maybe  implied  (暗示 ) is that the person  wants  the listener  to consider  what  has \nbeen  said before  continuing.  In these  cultures,  silence  is a call for reflection.  \nOther  cultures  may use silence  in other  ways,  particularly  when  dealing  with \nconflicts  among  people  or in relationships  of people  with different  amounts  of power.  \nFor example,  Russian,  French,  and Spanish  persons  may use silence  to show  \nagreement  between  parties  about  the topic  under  discussion.  However,  Mexicans  may \nuse silence  when  instructions  are given  by a person  in authority  rather  than be rude to \nthat person  by arguing  with him or her. In still another  use, persons  in Asian  cultures  \nmay view  silence  as a sign of respect,  particularly  to an elder  or a person  in authority.  \nNurses  and other  care-givers  need  to be aware  of the possible  meanings  of \nsilence  when  they come  across  the personal  anxiety  their patients  may be \nexperiencing.  Nurses  should  recognize  their own personal  and cultural  construction  of \nsilence  so that a patient’s  silence  is not interrupted  too early  or allowed  to go on \nunnecessarily.  A nurse  who understands  the healing  (治愈 ) value  of silence  can use \nthis understanding  to assist  in the care of patients  from  their own and from  other  \n  cultures.  \n32. What  does the author  say about  silence  in conversations?  \nA. It implies  anger.              B. It promotes  friendship.  \nC. It is culture-specific.           D. It is content-based.  \n33. Which  of the following  people  might  regard  silence  as a call for careful  thought?  \nA. The Chinese.     B. The French.     C. The Mexicans.    D. The Russians.  \n34. What  does the author  advise  nurses  to do about  silence?  \nA. Let it continue  as the patient  pleases.     B. Break  it while  treating  patients.  \nC. Evaluate  its harm  to patients.         D. Make  use of its healing  effects.  \n35. What  may be the best title for the text?  \nA. Sound  and Silence               B. What  It Means  to Be Silent  \nC.

I put a small  set of \nTinkertoys  in front  of each student,  and said:  “Make  something  out of the Tinkertoys.  \nYou have  45 minutes  today  ― and 45 minutes  each day for the rest of the week.”  \nA few students  hesitated  to start.  They  waited  to see what  the rest of the class  \nwould  do. Several  others  checked  the instructions  and made  something  according  to \none of the model  plans  provided.  Another  group  built something  out of their own \nimaginations.  \n  Once  I had a boy who worked  experimentally  with Tinkertoys  in his free time.  \nHis constructions  filled  a shelf  in the art classroom  and a good  part of his bedroom  at \nhome.  I was delighted  at the presence  of such a student.  Here  was an exceptionally  \ncreative  mind  at work.  His presence  meant  that I had an unexpected  teaching  assistant  \nin class  whose  creativity  would  infect  (感染 ) other  students.  \nEncouraging  this kind of thinking  has a downside . I ran the risk of losing  those  \nstudents  who had a different  style  of thinking.  Without  fail one would  declare,  “But  \nI’m just not creative.”  \n“Do you dream  at night  when  you’re  asleep?”  \n“Oh,  sure.”  \n“So tell me one of your most  interesting  dreams.”  The student  would  tell \nsomething  wildly  imaginative.  Flying  in the sky or in a time machine  or growing  three  \nheads.  “That’s  pretty  creative.  Who  does that for you?”  \n“Nobody.  I do it.” \n“Really  ― at night,  when  you’re  asleep?”  \n“Sure.”  \n“Try  doing  it in the daytime,  in class,  okay?”  \n25.

In fact, they were  shot from  \n1914  through  1916,  most  of them  after a disastrous  shipwreck  (海 难 ), by a \ncameraman  who had no reasonable  expectation  of survival.  Many  of the images  were  \nstored  in an ice chest,  under  freezing  water,  in the damaged  wooden  ship.  \nThe ship was the Endurance , a small,  tight,  Norwegian-built  three-master  that \nwas intended  to take Sir Ernest  Shackleton  and a small  crew  of seamen  and scientists,  \n27 men in all, to the southernmost  shore  of Antarctica’s  Weddell  Sea. From  that point  \nShackleton  wanted  to force  a passage  by dog sled (雪橇 ) across  the continent.  The \njourney  was intended  to achieve  more  than what  Captain  Robert  Falcon  Scott  had \ndone.  Captain  Scott  had reached  the South  Pole early  in 1912  but had died with his \nfour companions  on the march  back.  \nAs writer  Caroline  Alexander  makes  clear  in her forceful  and well-researched  \nstory  The Endurance , adventuring  was even  then a thoroughly  commercial  effort.  \nScott’s  last journey,  completed  as he lay in a tent dying  of cold and hunger,  caught  the \nworld’s  imagination,  and a film made  in his honor  drew  crowds.  Shackleton,  a \nonetime  British  merchant-navy  officer  who had got to within  100 miles  of the South  \nPole in 1908,  started  a business  before  his 1914  voyage  to make  money  from  movie  \nand still photography.  Frank  Hurley,  a confident  and gifted  Australian  photographer  \nwho knew  the Antarctic,  was hired  to make  the images,  most  of which  have  never  \nbefore  been  published.  \n33. What  do we know  about  the photos  taken  by Hurley?  \n  A. They  were  made  last week.         B. They  showed  undersea  sceneries.  \nC. They  were  found  by a cameraman.   D.

When her dinner partner showed up, she also pulled up a chair.\n“They began telling me all the news of Mississippi,” Welty said. “I didn’t know what my New York friends were thinking.”\n    Taxis on a rainy New York night are rarer than sunshine. By the time the group got up to leave, it was pouring outside. Welty’s new friends immediately sent a waiter to find a cab. Heading back downtown toward her hotel, her big-city friends were amazed at the turn of events that had changed their Big Apple dinner into a Mississippi state reunion (团聚).\n“My friends said: ‘Now we believe your stories,’” Welty added. “And I said: ‘Now you know. These are the people that make me write them.’”\nSitting on a sofa in her room, Welty, a slim figure in a simple gray dress, looked pleased with this explanation.\n“I don’t make them up,” she said of the characters in her fiction these last 50 or so years. “I don’t have to.”\nBeauticians, bartenders, piano players and people with purple hats, Welty’s people come from afternoons spent visiting with old friends, from walks through the streets of her native Jackson, Miss., from conversations overheard on a bus.

To people who are used to the limited choice of apples such as Golden Delicious and Royal Gala in supermarkets, it can be quite an eye opener to see the range of classical apples still in existence, such as Decio which was grown by the Romans. Although it doesn’t taste of anything special, it’s still worth a try, as is the knobbly (多疙瘩的) Cat’s Head which is more of a curiosity than anything else.\nThere are also varieties developed to suit specific local conditions. One of the very best varieties for eating quality is Orleans Reinette, but you’ll need a warm, sheltered place with perfect soil to grow it, so it’s a pipe dream for most apple lovers who fall for it.\nAt the events, you can meet expert growers and discuss which ones will best suit your conditions, and because these are family affairs, children are well catered for with apple-themed fun and games.\nApple Days are being held at all sorts of places with an interest in fruit, including stately gardens and commercial orchards (果园). If you want to have a real orchard experience, try visiting the National Fruit Collection at Brogdale, near Faversham in Kent.\n28. What can people do at the apple events?\nA.

But now that information is being spread and monitored (监控) in different ways, researchers are discovering new rules. By tracking people’s e-mails and online posts, scientists have found that good news can spread faster and farther than disasters and sob stories.\n   “The ‘if it bleeds’ rule works for mass media,” says Jonah Berger, a scholar at the University of Pennsylvania. “They want your eyeballs and don’t care how you’re feeling. But when you share a story with your friends, you care a lot more how they react. You don’t want them to think of you as a Debbie Downer.”\n   Researchers analyzing word-of-mouth communication — e-mails, Web posts and reviews, face-to-face conversations — found that it tended to be more positive than negative (消极的), but that didn’t necessarily mean people preferred positive news. Was positive news shared more often simply because people experienced more good things than bad things? To test for that possibility, Dr. Berger looked at how people spread a particular set of news stories: thousands of articles on The New York Times’ website. He and a Penn colleague analyzed the “most e-mailed” list for six months. One of his first findings was that articles in the science section were much more likely to make the list than non-science articles. He found that science amazed Times’ readers and made them want to share this positive feeling with others.\nReaders also tended to share articles that were exciting or funny, or that inspired negative feelings like anger or anxiety, but not articles that left them merely sad. They needed to be aroused (激发) one way or the other, and they preferred good news to bad. The more positive an article, the more likely it was to be shared, as Dr. Berger explains in his new book, “Contagious: Why Things Catch On.” \n32. What do the classic rules mentioned in the text apply to?\nA. News reports.    \t    B. Research papers.  \t\t\nC. Private e-mails.    \tD. Daily conversations.\n33. What can we infer about people like Debbie Downer?\nA. They’re socially inactive.        B. They’re good at telling stories.\nC. They’re inconsiderate of others.   D. They’re careful with their words.\n34. Which tended to be the most e-mailed according to Dr. Berger’s research?\nA. Sports news.      \t  B. Science articles.    \t\t\nC. Personal accounts.  \t  D. Financial reviews.\n35. What can be a suitable title for the text?\nA. Sad Stories Travel Far and Wide       \nB .Online News Attracts More People\nC.

Trying  to help injured,  displaced  or sick creatures  \ncan be heartbreaking;  survival  is never  certain.  However,  when  it works,  it is simply  \nbeautiful.  \n I got a rescue  call from  a woman  in Muttontown.  She had found  a young  owl (猫\n头鹰 ) on the ground.  When  I arrived,  I saw a 2-to 3-week-old  owl. It had already  been  \nplaced  in a carrier  for safety.  \n I examined  the chick  (雏鸟 ) and it seemed  fine. If I could  locate  the nest, I might  \nhave  been  able to put it back,  but no luck.  My next work  was to construct  a nest and \nanchor  it in a tree. \n The homeowner  was very helpful.  A wire basket  was found.  I put some  pine \nbranches  into the basket  to make  this nest safe and comfortable.  I placed  the chick  in \nthe nest, and it quickly  calmed  down.  \n Now  all that was needed  were  the parents,  but they were  absent.  I gave  the \nhomeowner  a recording  of the hunger  screams  of owl chicks.  These  advertise  the \npresence  of chicks  to adults;  they might  also encourage  our chick  to start calling  as \nwell.

        "instruction": "C \nSome  of the world’s  most  famous  musicians  recently  gathered  in Paris  and New  \nOrleans  to celebrate  the first annual  International  Jazz Day.  UNESCO(  United  \nNations  Educational,  Scientific  and Cultural  Organization)  recently  set April  30 as a \nday to raise  awareness  of jazz music,  its significance,  and its potential  as a unifying  (\n联合 ) voice  across  cultures.  \nDespite  the celebrations,  though,  in the U.S. the jazz audience  continues  to \nshrink  and grow  older,  and the music  has failed  to connect  with younger  generations.  \nIt’s Jason  Moran’s  job to help change  that. As the Kennedy  Center’s  artistic  \nadviser  for jazz, Moran  hopes  to widen  the audience  for jazz, make  the music  more  \naccessible,  and preserve  its history  and culture.  \n“Jazz  seems  like it’s not really  a part of the American  appetite,”  Moran  tells \nNational  Public  Radio’s  reporter  Neal  Conan.  “What  I’m hoping  to accomplish  is that \nmy generation  and younger  start to reconsider  and understand  that jazz is not black  \nand write  anymore.  It’s actually  color,  and it’s actually  digital.”  \n  Moran  says one of the problems  with jazz today  is that the entertainment  aspect  \nof the music  has been  lost. “The  music  can’t  be presented  today  the way it was in \n1908  or 1958.  It has to continue  to move,  because  the way the world  works  is not the \nsame,”  says Moran.  \nLast year,  Moran  worked  on a project  that arranged  Fats Waller’s  music  for a \ndance  party,  “Just  to kind of put it back  in the mind  that Waller  is dance  music  as \nmuch  as it is concert  music,”  says Moran.  “For me, it’s the recontextualization.  In \nmusic,  where  does the emotion  (情感 ) lie? Are we, as humans,  gaining  any insight  (\n感悟 ) on how to talk about  ourselves  and how something  as abstract  as a Charlie  \nParker  record  gets us into a dialogue  about  our emotions  and our thoughts?  \nSometimes  we lose sight  that the music  has a wider  context,”  says Moran,  “so I want  \nto continue  those  dialogues.  Those  are the things  I want  to foster.”  \n28. Why  did UNESCO  set April  30 as International  Jazz Day?  \nA. To remember  the birth  of jazz. \nB. To protect  cultural  diversity.  \nC. To encourage  people  to study  music.  \nD. To recognize  the value  of jazz. \n29. What  does the underlined  word  “that”  in paragraph  3 refer  to? \nA. Jazz becoming  more  accessible.  \nB. The production  of jazz growing  faster.  \nC. Jazz being  less popular  with the young.  \nD. The jazz audience  becoming  larger.   \n30. What  can we infer  about  Moran’s  opinion  on jazz?  \nA. It will disappear  gradually.          B. It remains  black  and white.  \nC. It should  keep  up with the times.     D. It changes  every  50 years.  \n31. Which  of the following  can be the best title for the text?  \nA. Exploring  the Future  of Jazz.     B. The Rise and Fall of Jazz.  \nC. The Story  of a Jazz Musician.     D.

Developed  by two doctors  in \nthe U.S. Department  of Agriculture,  it’s an excellent  water  collector.  Unfortunately,  \nyou must  carry  the necessary  equipment  with you, since  it’s all but impossible  to find \nnatural  substitutes.  The only components  required,  though,  are a 5'×5'  sheet  of clear  or \nslightly  milky  plastic,  six feet of plastic  tube,  and a container  — perhaps  just a \ndrinking  cup — to catch  the water.  These  pieces  can be folded  into a neat little pack  \nand fastened  on your belt. \n    To construct  a working  still, use a sharp  stick  or rock to dig a hole four feet \nacross  and three  feet deep.  Try to make  the hole in a damp  area to increase  the water  \ncatcher’s  productivity.  Place  your cup in the deepest  part of the hole.  Then  lay the \ntube in place  so that one end rests all the way in the cup and the rest of the line runs \nup — and out — the side of the hole.  \nNext,  cover  the hole with the plastic  sheet,  securing  the edges  of the plastic  with \ndirt and weighting  the sheet’s  center  down  with a rock.  The plastic  should  now form  a \ncone  (圆锥体 ) with 45-degree-angled  sides.  The low point  of the sheet  must  be \ncentered  directly  over,  and no more  than three  inches  above,  the cup.  \nThe solar  still works  by creating  a greenhouse  under  the plastic.  Ground  water  \nevaporates  (蒸发 ) and collects  on the sheet  until small  drops  of water  form,  run down  \nthe material  and fall off into the cup. When  the container  is full, you can suck the \nrefreshment  out through  the tube,  and won’t  have  to break  down  the still every  time \nyou need  a drink.   \n32. What  do we know  about  the solar  still equipment  from  the first paragraph?  \nA. It’s delicate.    B. It’s expensive.    C. It’s complex.    D. It’s portable.  \n33. What  does the underlined  phrase  “the water  catcher”  in paragraph  2 refer  to? \nA. The tube.       B. The still.       C. The hole.       D. The cup. \n34. What’s  the last step of constructing  a working  solar  still?  \nA. Dig a hole of a certain  size.       B. Put the cup in place.  \nC. Weight  the sheet’s  center  down.     D.

The Transition,  which  flew at 1,400  feet for eight  \nminutes  last month,  can reach  around  70 miles  per hour on the road and 115 in the air. \nIt flies using  a 23-gallon  tank of gas and bums  5 gallons  per hour in the air. On the \nground,  it gets 35 miles  per gallon.  \nAround  100 people  have  already  put down  a $10,000  deposit  to get a Transition  \nwhen  they go on sale, and those  numbers  will likely  rise after Terrafugia  introduces  \n  the Transition  to the public  later this week  at the New  York  Auto  Show.

Terrafugia  says an owner  would  \nneed  to pass a test and complete  20 hours  of flying  time to be able to fly the \nTransition,  a requirement  pilots  would  find redatively  easy to meet.  \n28.

Back  in 1983,  two \nscientists,  Jack Schultz  and Ian Baldwin,  reported  that young  maple  trees  getting  \nbitten  by insects  send out a particular  smell  that neighboring  plants  can get. These  \n  chemicals  come  from  the injured  parts  of the plant  and seem  to be an alarm.  What  the \nplants  pump  through  the air is a mixture  of chemicals  known  as volatile  organic  \ncompounds,  VOCs  for short.  \nScientists  have  found  that all kinds  of plants  give out VOCs  when  being  \nattacked.  It’s a plant’s  way of crying  out. But is anyone  listening?  Apparently.  \nBecause  we can watch  the neighbours  react.  \nSome  plants  pump  out smelly  chemicals  to keep  insects  away.  But others  do \ndouble  duty.  They  pump  out perfumes  designed  to attract  different  insects  who are \nnatural  enemies  to the attackers.  Once  they arrive,  the tables  are turned . The attacker  \nwho was lunching  now becomes  lunch.  \nIn study  after study,  it appears  that these  chemical  conversations  help the \nneighbors.  The damage  is usually  more  serious  on the first plant,  but the neighbors,  \nrelatively  speaking,  stay safer  because  they heard  the alarm  and knew  what  to do. \nDoes  this mean  that plants  talk to each other?  Scientists  don’t  know.  Maybe  the \nfirst plant  just made  a cry of pain or was sending  a message  to its own branches,  and \nso, in effect,  was talking  to itself.  Perhaps  the neighbors  just happened  to “overhear”  \nthe cry. So information  was exchanged,  but it wasn’t  a true, intentional  back  and \nforth.  \nCharles  Darwin,  over 150 years  ago, imagined  a world  far busier,  noisier  and \nmore  intimate  (亲密的 ) than the world  we can see and hear.

It was a scene that had been repeated many times in the theater’s 75-year history. This time, however, the cleanup was a little different. As one group of workers carried out the rubbish, another group began removing seats and other theater equipment in preparation for the building’s end.\nThe film classic The Last Picture Show was the last movie shown in the old theater. Though the movie is 30 years old, most of the 250 seats were filled with teary-eyed audience wanting to say good-bye to the old building. Theater owner Ed Bradford said he chose the movie because it seemed appropriate. The movie is set in a small town where the only movie theater is preparing to close down.\nBradford said that large modern theaters in the city made it impossible for the Plaza to compete. He added that the theater’s location (位置) was also a reason. “This used to be the center of town,” he said. “Now the area is mostly office buildings and warehouses.”\nLast week some city officials suggested the city might be interested in turning the old theater into a museum and public meeting place. However, these plans were abandoned because of financial problems. Bradford sold the building and land to a local development firm, which plans to build a shopping complex on the land where the theater is located.\nThe theater audience said good-bye as Bradford locked the doors for the last time. After 75 years the Plaza Theater has shown its last movie. The theater will be missed.\n24. In what way was yesterday’s cleanup at the Plaza special?\nA. It made room for new equipment.\nB. It signaled the closedown of the theater.\nC. It was done with the help of the audience.\nD. It marked the 75th anniversary of the theater.\n25. Why was The Last Picture Show put on?\nA.

        "instruction": "C\nAfter years of heated debate, gray wolves were reintroduced to Yellowstone National Park. Fourteen wolves were caught in Canada and transported to the park. By last year, the Yellowstone wolf population had grown to more than 170 wolves.\nGray wolves once were seen here and there in the Yellowstone area and much of the continental United States, but they were gradually displaced by human development. By the 1920s, wolves had practically disappeared from the Yellowstone area. They went farther north into the deep forests of Canada, where there were fewer humans around.\nThe disappearance of the wolves had many unexpected results. Deer and elk populations — major food sources (来源) for the wolf — grew rapidly. These animals consumed large amounts of vegetation (植被), which reduced plant diversity in the park. In the absence of wolves, coyote populations also grew quickly. The coyotes killed a large percentage of the park’s red foxes, and completely drove away the park’s beavers.\nAs early as 1966, biologists asked the government to consider reintroducing wolves to Yellowstone Park. They hoped that wolves would be able to control the elk and coyote problems. Many farmers opposed the plan because they feared that wolves would kill their farm animals or pets.\n    The government spent nearly 30 years coming up with a plan to reintroduce the wolvers. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service carefully monitors and manages the wolf packs in Yellowstone. Today, the debate continues over how well the gray wolf is fitting in at Yellowstone. Elk, deer, and coyote populations are down, while beavers and red fores have made a comeback. The Yellowstone wolf project has been a valuable experiment to help biologists decide whether to reintroduce wolves to other parts of the country as well.\n28. What is the text mainly about?\nA. Wildlife research in the United States.\nB. Plant diversity in the Yellowstone area.\nC. The conflict between farmers and gray wolves.\nD. The reintroduction of wolves to Yellowstone Park.\n29. What does the underlined word “displaced” in paragraph 2 mean?\nA. Tested.\t\tB. Separated.\t\tC. Forced out.\t\tD. Tracked down.\n30. What did the disappearance of gray wolves bring about？\nA. Damage to local ecology.     B. A decline in the park’s income.\nC. Preservation of vegetation.    D. An increase in the variety of animals.\n31. What is the author’s attitude towards the Yellowstone wolf project？\nA. Doubtful.       B. Positive.      C. Disapproving.      D. Uncaring.",

Phil Blythe explains: “For many older people, particularly those living alone or in the country, driving is important for preserving their independence, giving them the freedom to get out and about without having to rely on others.”\n“But we all have to accept that as we get older our reactions slow down and this often results in people avoiding any potentially challenging driving conditions and losing confidence in their driving skills. The result is that people stop driving before they really need to.”\nDr Amy Guo, the leading researcher on the older driver study, explains, “The Drive LAB is helping us to understand what the key points and difficulties are for older drivers and how we might use technology to address these problems.\n“For example, most of us would expect older drivers always go slower than everyone else but surprisingly, we found that in 30mph zones they struggled to keep at a constant speed and so were more likely to break the speed limit and be at risk of getting fined. We’re looking at the benefits of systems which control their speed as a way of preventing that.\n“We hope that our work will help with technological solutions (解决方案) to ensure that older drivers stay safer behind the wheel.”\n32.

That’s  bad news  for the environment  — \nand our wallets  — as these  outdated  devices  consume  much  more  energy  than the \nnewer  ones that do the same  things.  \nTo figure  out how much  power  these  devices  are using,  Callie  Babbitt  and her \ncolleagues  at the Rochester  Institute  of Technology  in New  York  tracked  the \nenvironmental  costs  for each product  throughout  its life — from  when  its minerals  are \nmined  to when  we stop using  the device.  This method  provided  a readout  for how \nhome  energy  use has evolved  since  the early  1990s.  Devices  were  grouped  by \ngeneration  — Desktop  computers,  basic  mobile  phones,  and box-set  TVs defined  \n1992.  Digital  cameras  arrived  on the scene  in 1997.  And MP3  players,  smart  phones,  \nand LCD  TVs entered  homes  in 2002,  before  tablets  and e-readers  showed  up in 2007.  \nAs we accumulated  more  devices,  however,  we didn ’t throw  out our old ones.  \n“The living-room  television  is replaced  and gets planted  in the kids’ room,  and \nsuddenly  one day, you have  a TV in every  room  of the house, ” said one researcher.  \nThe average  number  of electronic  devices  rose from  four per household  in 1992  to 13 \nin 2007.  We’re not just keeping  these  old devices  — we continue  to use them.  \nAccording  to the analysis  of Babbitt ’s team,  old desktop  monitors  and box TVs with \ncathode  ray tubes  are the worst  devices  with their energy  consumption  and \ncontribution  to greenhouse  gas emissions （排放） more  than doubling  during  the \n1992  to 2007  window.  \n  So what ’s the solution（解决方案） ? The team ’s data only went  up to 2007,  but \nthe researchers  also explored  what  would  happen  if consumers  replaced  old products  \nwith new electronics  that serve  more  than one function,  such as a tablet  for word  \nprocessing  and TV viewing.  They  found  that more  on-demand  entertainment  viewing  \non tablets  instead  of TVs and desktop  computers  could  cut energy  consumption  by \n44%.  \n32. What  does the author  think  of new devices?  \nA. They  are environment-friendly.   B. They  are no better  than the old. \nC. They  cost more  to use at home.   D. They  go out of style  quickly.  \n33. Why  did Babbitt's  team  conduct  the research?  \nA. To reduce  the cost of minerals.  \nB. To test the life cycle  of a product.  \nC. To update  consumers  on new technology.  \nD. To find out electricity  consumption  of the devices.  \n34. Which  of the following  uses the least energy?  \nA. The box-set  TV.    B.

It’s possible  that we all have  compromised  conversational  \nintelligence.  It’s more  likely  that none  of us start a conversation  because  it’s \nawkward  and challenging,  or we think  it’s annoying  and unnecessary.  But the next \ntime you find yourself  among  strangers,  consider  that small  talk is worth  the trouble.  \nExperts  say it’s an invaluable  social  practice  that results  in big benefits.  \nDismissing  small  talk as unimportant  is easy,  but we can’t  forget  that deep  \nrelationships  wouldn’t  even  exist  if it weren’t  for casual  conversation.  Small  talk is \nthe grease  (润滑剂 ) for social  communication,  says Bernardo  Carducci,  director  of \nthe Shyness  Research  Institute  at Indiana  University  Southeast.  “Almost  every  great  \nlove story  and each big business  deal begins  with small  talk,”  he explains.  “The  key \nto successful  small  talk is learning  how to connect  with others,  not just communicate  \nwith them.”  \nIn a 2014  study,  Elizabeth  Dunn,  associate  professor  of psychology  at UBC,  \ninvited  people  on their way into a coffee  shop.  One group  was asked  to seek out an \ninteraction  (互动 ) with its waiter;  the other,  to speak  only when  necessary.  The \nresults  showed  that those  who chatted  with their server  reported  significantly  higher  \npositive  feelings  and a better  coffee  shop  experience.  “It’s not that talking  to the \nwaiter  is better  than talking  to your husband,”  say Dunn.  “But  interactions  with \nperipheral  (边缘的 ) members  of our social  network  matter  for our well-being  also.”  \nDunn  believes  that people  who reach  out to strangers  feel a significantly  greater  \nsense  of belonging,  a bond  with others.  Carducci  believes  developing  such a sense  of \nbelonging  starts  with small  talk. “Small  talk is the basis  of good  manners,”  he says.  \n32. What  phenomenon  is described  in the first paragraph?  \nA. Addiction  to smartphones.  \nB. Inappropriate  behaviours  in public  places.  \nC. Absence  of communication  between  strangers.  \nD.

        "instruction": "B\nCities usually have a good reason for being where they are, like a nearby port or river. People settle in these places because they are easy to get to and naturally suited to communications and trade. New York City, for example, is near a large harbour at the mouth of the Hudson River. Over 300 years its population grew gradually from 800 people to 8 million. But not all cities develop slowly over a long period of time. Boom towns grow from nothing almost overnight. In 1896, Dawson, Canada, was unmapped wilderness (荒野). But gold was discovered there in 1897, and two years later, it was one of the largest cities in the West, with a population of 30,000.\nDawson did not have any of the natural conveniences of cities like London or Paris. People went there for gold. They travelled over snow-covered mountains and sailed hundreds of miles up icy rivers. The path to Dawson was covered with thirty feet of wet snow that could fall without warming. An avalanche(雪崩) once closed the path, killing 63 people. For many who made it to Dawson, however, the rewards were worth the difficult trip. Of the first 20,000 people who dug for gold, 4,000 got rich. About 100 of these stayed rich men for the rest of their lives.\nBut no matter how rich they were, Dawson was never comfortable. Necessities like food and wood were very expensive. But soon, the gold that Dawson depended on had all been found. The city was crowded with disappointed people with no interest in settling down, and when they heard there were new gold discoveries in Alaska, they left Dawson City as quickly as they had come. Today, people still come and go — to see where the Canadian gold rush happened. Tourism is now the chief industry of Dawson City — its present population is 762.\n24. What attracted the early settlers to New York City?\nA. Its business culture.            B. Its small population.[来]\nC. Its geographical position.        D. Its favourable climate.\n25. What do we know about those who first dug for gold in Dawson?\nA. Two-thirds of them stayed there.      B. One out of five people got rich.\nC. Almost everyone gave up.           D. Half of them died.\n26. What was the main reason for many people to leave Dawson?\nA. They found the city too crowded.   B. They wanted to try their luck elsewhere.\nC.

Wang Shu, a 49-year-old Chinese architect, won the 2012 Pritzker Architecture Prize — which is often referred to as the Nobel Prize in architecture — on February 28. He is the first Chinese citizen to win this award.\nWang serves as head of the Architecture Department at the China Academy of Art (CAA). His office is located at the Xiangshan campus (校园) of the university in Hangzhou, Zhejiang Province. Many buildings on the campus are his original creations.\nThe style of the campus is quite different from that of most Chinese universities. Many visitors were amazed by the complex architectural space and abundant building types. The curves (曲线) of the buildings perfectly match the rise and fall of hills, forming a unique view.\nWang collected more than 7 million abandoned bricks of different ages. He asked the workers to use traditional techniques to make the bricks into walls, roofs and corridors. This creation attracted a lot of attention thanks to its mixture of modern and traditional Chinese elements (元素).\nWang’s works show a deep understanding of modern architecture and a good knowledge of traditions. Through such a balance, he had created a new type of Chinese architecture, said Tadao Ando, the winner of the 1995 Pritzker Prize.\nWang believes traditions should not be sealed in glass boxes at museums. “That is only evidence that traditions once existed,” he said.\n“Many Chinese people have a misunderstanding of traditions. They think tradition means old things from the past. In fact, tradition also refers to the things that have been developing and that are still being created,” he said.\n“Today, many Chinese people are learning Western styles and theories rather than focusing on Chinese traditions. Many people tend to talk about traditions without knowing what they really are,” said Wang.学K]\nThe study of traditions should be combined with practice. Otherwise, the recreation of traditions would be artificial and empty, he said.\n28. Wang’s winning of the prize means that Chinese architects are ___________.\nA. following the latest world trend       B. getting international recognition\nC. working harder than ever before       D. relying on foreign architects\n29. What impressed visitors to the CAA Xiangshan campus most?\nA. Its hilly environment. \tB. Its large size.\nC. Its unique style.\t\t\tD. Its diverse functions.\n30. What made Wang’s architectural design a success?\nA. The mixture of different shapes.       B. The balance of East and West.\nC. The use of popular techniques.        D.

At present, these technologies are still expensive, though.\nResearchers from Georgia Tech say that they have come up with a low-cost device(装置)that gets around this problem: a smart keyboard. This smart keyboard precisely measures the cadence(节奏)with which one types and the pressure fingers apply to each key. The keyboard could offer a strong layer of security by analyzing things like the force of a user's typing and the time between key presses. These patterns are unique to each person. Thus, the keyboard can determine people's identities, and by extension, whether they should be given access to the computer it's connected to—regardless of whether someone gets the password right.\nIt also doesn't require a new type of technology that people aren't already familiar with. Everybody uses a keyboard and everybody types differently.\nIn a study describing the technology, the researchers had 100 volunteers type the word “touch”four times using the smart keyboard. Data collected from the device could be used to recognize different participants based on how they typed, with very low error rates. The researchers say that the keyboard should be pretty straightforward to commercialize and is mostly made of inexpensive, plastic-like parts.

Then came my tweens and teens, and mean girls and cool kids. They rose in the ranks not by being friendly but by smoking cigarettes, breaking rules and playing jokes on others, among whom I soon found myself.\nPopularity is a well-explored subject in social psychology. Mitch Prinstein, a professor of clinical psychology sorts the popular into two categories: the likable and the status seekers. The likables’ plays-well-with-others qualities strengthen schoolyard friendships, jump-start interpersonal skills and, when tapped early, are employed ever after in life and work. Then there’s the kind of popularity that appears in adolescence: status born of power and even dishonorable behavior.\nEnviable as the cool kids may have seemed, Dr. Prinstein’s studies show unpleasant consequences. Those who were highest in status in high school, as well as those least liked in elementary school, are “most likely to engage(从事)in dangerous and risky behavior.”\nIn one study, Dr. Prinstein examined the two types of popularity in 235 adolescents, scoring the least liked, the most liked and the highest in status based on student surveys(调查研究). “We found that the least well-liked teens had become more aggressive over time toward their classmates. But so had those who were high in status. It clearly showed that while likability can lead to healthy adjustment, high status has just the opposite effect on us.\"\nDr. Prinstein has also found that the qualities that made the neighbors want you on a play date-sharing, kindness, openness — carry over to later years and make you better able to relate and connect with others.\nIn analyzing his and other research，Dr. Prinstein came to another conclusion: Not only is likability related to positive life outcomes, but it is also responsible for those outcomes, too. \"Being liked creates opportunities for learning and for new kinds of life experiences that help somebody gain an advantage, ” he said.\n32.

She may just need a little persuading. So I try again and tug at the heartstrings. I mention the single parent with four kids running the show and I talk about the dad coaching a team that his kids aren’t even on … At this point the unwilling parent speaks up,“Alright. Yes, I’ll do it.”\nI’m secretly relieved because I know there’s real power in sharing volunteer responsibilities among many. The unwilling parent organizes the meal schedule, sends out emails, and collects money for end-of-season gifts. Somewhere along the way, the same parent ends up becoming an invaluable member of the team. The coach is able to focus on the kids while the other parents are relieved to be off the hook for another season. Handing out sliced oranges to bloodthirsty kids can be as exciting as watching your own kid score a goal.\nStill, most of us volunteers breathe a sigh of relief when the season comes to a close. That relief is coupled with a deep understanding of why the same people keep coming back for more: Connecting to the community(社区)as you freely give your time, money, skills, or services provides a real joy. Volunteering just feels so good.\nIn that sense, I’m pretty sure volunteering is more of a selfish act than I’d freely like to admit. However, if others benefit in the process, and I get some reward too, does it really matter where my motivation lies?\n24. What can we infer about the parent from her reply in paragraph l？\nA. She knows little about the club.\nB. She isn't good at sports.\nC. She just doesn't want to volunteer.\nD. She's unable to meet her schedule.\n25.

Today $8 or $10 seems a small amount of money, but at that time these amounts were forbidding to most citizens. Accordingly, newspapers were read almost only by rich people in politics or the trades. In addition, most newspapers had little in them that would appeal to a mass audience. They were dull and visually forbidding. But the revolution that was taking place in the 1830s would change all that.\nThe trend, then, was toward the \"penny paper\"-a term referring to papers made widely available to the public. It meant any inexpensive newspaper; perhaps more importantly it meant newspapers that could be bought in single copies on the street.\nThis development did not take place overnight. It had been possible(but not easy)to buy single copies of newspapers before 1830,but this usually meant the reader had to go down to the printer's office to purchase a copy. Street sales were almost unknown. However, within a few years, street sales of newspapers would be commonplace in eastern cities. At first the price of single copies was seldom a penny-usually two or three cents was charged-and some of the older well-known papers charged five or six cents. But the phrase \"penny paper \" caught the public's fancy, and soon there would be papers that did indeed sell for only a penny.\nThis new trend of newspapers for \"the man on the street\" did not begin well. Some of the early ventures(企业)were immediate failures. Publishers already in business, people who were owners of successful papers, had little desire to change the tradition.

The researchers then tested how the monkeys combined—or added—the symbols to get the reward.\nHere's how Harvard Medical School scientist Margaret Livingstone, who led the team, described the experiment: In their cages the monkeys were provided with touch screens. On one part of the screen, a symbol would appear, and on the other side two symbols inside a circle were shown. For example, the number 7 would flash on one side of the screen and the other end would have 9 and 8. If the monkeys touched the left side of the screen they would be rewarded with seven drops of water or juice; if they went for the circle, they would be rewarded with the sum of the numbers—17 in this example.\nAfter running hundreds of tests, the researchers noted that the monkeys would go for the higher values more than half the time, indicating that they were performing a calculation, not just memorizing the value of each combination.\nWhen the team examined the results of the experiment more closely, they noticed that the monkeys tended to underestimate(低估)a sum compared with a single symbol when the two were close in value—sometimes choosing, for example, a 13 over the sum of 8 and 6. The underestimation was systematic: When adding two numbers, the monkeys always paid attention to the larger of the two, and then added only a fraction(小部分)of the smaller number to it.\n\"This indicates that there is a certain way quantity is represented in their brains, \"Dr. Livingstone says. “But in this experiment what they're doing is paying more attention to the big number than the little one.”\n32.

        "instruction": "B\nReturning to a book you’ve read many times can feel like drinks with an old friend. There’s a welcome familiarity - but also sometimes a slight suspicion that time has changed you both, and thus the relationship. But books don’t change, people do. And that’s what makes the act of rereading so rich and transformative.\nThe beauty of rereading lies in the idea that our bond with the work is based on our present mental register. It’s true, the older I get, the more I feel time has wings. But with reading, it’s all about the present. It’s about the now and what one contributes to the now, because reading is a give and take between author and reader. Each has to pull their own weight.\nThere are three books I reread annually The first, which I take to reading every spring is Emest Hemningway’s A Moveable Feast. Published in 1964, it’s his classic memoir of 1920s Paris. The language is almost intoxicating (令人陶醉的)，an aging writer looking back on an ambitious yet simpler time. Another is Annie Dillard’s Holy the Firm, her poetic 1975 ramble (随笔) about everything and nothing. The third book is Julio Cortazar’s Save Twilight: Selected Poems, because poetry. And because Cortazar.\nWhile I tend to buy a lot of books, these three were given to me as gifs, which might add to the meaning I attach to them. But I imagine that, while money is indeed wonderful and necessary, rereading an author’s work is the highest currency a reader can pay them. The best books are the ones that open further as time passes. But remember, it’s you that has to grow and read and reread in order to better understand your friends.\n24. Why does the author like rereading?\nA. It evaluates the writer-reader relationship.\nB. It’s a window to a whole new world.\nC. It’s a substitute for drinking with a friend.\nD. It extends the understanding of oneself.\n25. What do we know about the book A Moveable Feas!?\nA. It’s a brief account of a trip.\nB. It’s about Hemingway’s life as a young man.\nC. It’s a record of a historic event.\nD. It’s about Hemingway’s friends in Paris.\n26. What does the underlined word ＂currency＂ in paragraph 4 refer to?\nA. Debt\nB. Reward.\nC. Allowance.\nD.

        "instruction": "C\nRace walking shares many fitness benefits with running, research shows, while most likely contributing to fewer injuries. It does, however, have its own problem.\nRace walkers are conditioned athletes. The longest track and field event at the Summer Olympics is the 50-kilometer race walk, which is about five miles longer than the marathon. But the sport’s rules require that a race walker’s knees stay straight through most of the leg swing and one foot remain in contact (接触) with the ground at all times. It’s this strange form that makes race walking such an attractive activity, however, says Jaclyn Norberg, an assistant professor of exercise science at Salem State University in Salem, Mass.\nLike running, race walking is physically demanding, she says, According to most calculations, race walkers moving at a pace of six miles per hour would burn about 800 calories(卡路里) per hour, which is approximately twice as many as they would burn walking, although fewer than running, which would probably burn about 1,000 or more calories per hour.\nHowever, race walking does not pound the body as much as running does, Dr. Norberg says. According to her research, runners hit the ground with as much as four times their body weight per step, while race walkers, who do not leave the ground, create only about 1.4 times their body weight with each step.\nAs a result, she says, some of the injuries associated with running, such as runner’s knee, are uncommon among race walkers. But the sport’s strange form does place considerable stress on the ankles and hips, so people with a history of such injuries might want to be cautious in adopting the sport. In fact, anyone wishing to try race walking should probably first consult a coach or experienced racer to learn proper technique, she says. It takes some practice.\n28. Why are race walkers conditioned athletes?\nA. They must run long distances.\nB. They are qualified for the marathon.\nC. They have to follow special rules.\nD. They are good at swinging their legs.\n29. What advantage does race walking have over running?\nA. It’s more popular at the Olympics.\nB. It’s less challenging physically.\nC. It’s more effective in body building.\nD. It’s less likely to cause knee injuries.\n30. What is Dr. Norberg’s suggestion for someone trying race walking?\nA. Getting experts’ opinions.\nB. Having a medical checkup.\nC. Hiring an experienced coach.\nD. Doing regular exercises.\n31. Which word best describes the author’s attitude to race walking?\nA. Skeptical.\tB. Objective.\nC. Tolerant.\tD. Conservative.",

A study conducted in Youngstown，Ohio，for example, discovered that greener areas of the city experienced less crime. In another，employees were shown to be 15% more productive when their workplaces were decorated with houseplants.\nThe engineers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology(MIT)have taken it a step further changing the actual composition of plants in order to get them to perform diverse，even unusual functions. These include plants that have sensors printed onto their leaves to show when they’re short of water and a plant that can detect harmful chemicals in groundwater. ＂We’re thinking about how we can engineer plants to replace functions of the things that we use every day,＂explained Michael Strano, a professor of chemical engineering at MIT.\nOne of his latest projects has been to make plants glow(发光)in experiments using some common vegetables. Strano’s team found that they could create a faint light for three-and-a-half hours. The light，about one-thousandth of the amount needed to read by，is just a start. The technology, Strano said, could one day be used to light the rooms or even to turn tree into self-powered street lamps.\nin the future，the team hopes to develop a version of the technology that can be sprayed onto plant leaves in a one-off treatment that would last the plant’s lifetime. The engineers are also trying to develop an on and off＂switch＂where the glow would fade when exposed to daylight.\nLighting accounts for about 7% of the total electricity consumed in the US. Since lighting is often far removed from the power source(电源)-such as the distance from a power plant to street lamps on a remote highway-a lot of energy is lost during transmission(传输).\nGlowing plants could reduce this distance and therefore help save energy.\n32.

But they weren’t there to throw red paint on fur-coat-wearing film stars. Instead, one activist, dressed in a full-body monkey suit, had arrived with a sign praising the filmmakers: “Thanks for not using real apes (猿)!”\nThe creative team behind “Apes” used motion-capture (动作捕捉) technology to create digitalized animals, spending tens of millions of dollars on technology that records an actor’s performance and later processes it with computer graphics to create a final image (图像). In this case, one of a realistic-looking ape.\nYet “Apes” is more exception than the rule. In fact, Hollywood has been hot on live animals lately. One nonprofit organization, which monitors the treatment of animals in filmed entertainment, is keeping tabs on more than 2,000 productions this year. Already, a number of films, including “Water for Elephants,” “The Hangover Part Ⅱ” and “Zookeeper,” have drawn the anger of activists who say the creatures acting in them haven’t been treated properly.\nIn some cases, it’s not so much the treatment of the animals on set in the studio that has activists worried; it’s the off-set training and living conditions that are raising concerns. And there are questions about the films made outside the States, which sometimes are not monitored as closely as productions filmed in the States.\n24.

They share a front door and a washing machine, but Rita Whitehead has her own kitchen, bathroom, bedroom and living room on the ground floor.\n“We floated the idea to my mum of sharing at a house,” says Kathryn Whitehead. Rita cuts in: “We spoke more with Nick because I think it’s a big thing for Nick to live with his mother-in-law.”\nAnd what does Nick think? “From my standpoint, it all seems to work very well. Would I recommend it? Yes, I think I would.”\nIt’s hard to tell exactly how many people agree with him, but research indicates that the numbers have been rising for some time. Official reports suggest that the number of households with three generations living together had risen from 325,000 in 2001to 419,000 in 2013.\nOther varieties of multigenerational family are more common. Some people live with their elderly parents; many more adult children are returning to the family home, if they ever left. It is said that about 20% of 25-34-year-olds live with their parents, compared with 16% in 1991.The total number of all multigenerational households in Britain is thought to be about 1.8 million.\nStories like that are more common in parts of the world where multigenerational living is more firmly rooted.

Cattle -raising people in East Africa and northern Europe have gained a mutation (突变) that helps them digest milk as adults.\nOn Thursday in an article published in Cell, a team of researchers reported a new kind of adaptation - not to air or to food, but to the ocean. A group of sea-dwelling people in Southeast Asia have evolved into better divers. The Bajau, as these people are known, number in the hundreds of thousands in Indonesia, Malaysia and the Philippines. They have traditionally lived on houseboats; in recent times, they’ve also built houses on stilts (支柱) in coastal waters. “They are simply a stranger to the land,” said Redney C. Jubilado, a University of Hawaii researcher who studies the Bajau.\nDr. Jubilado first met the Bajau while growing up on Samal Island in the Philippines. They made a living as divers, spearfishing or harvesting shellfish. “We were so amazed that they could stay underwater much longer than us local islanders,” Dr. Jubilado said. “I could see them actually walking under the sea.”\nIn2015, Melissa Ilardo, then a graduate student in genetics at the University of Copenhagen, heard about the Bajau. She wondered if centuries of diving could have led to the evolution of physical characteristics that made the task easier for them. “it seemed like the perfect chance for natural selection to act on a population,” said Dr. Ilardo.

        "instruction": "D\nDuring an interview for one of my books, my interviewer said something I still think about often. Annoyed by the level of distraction（干扰）in his open office, he said, “That’s why I have a membership at the coworking space across the street — so I can focus”. His comment struck me as strange. After all, coworking spaces also typically use an open office layout（布局）. But I recently came across a study that shows why his approach works. \nThe researchers examined various levels of noise on participants as they completed tests of creative thinking. They were randomly divided into four groups and exposed to various noise levels in the background, from total silence to 50 decibels（分贝）, 70 decibels, and 85 decibels. The differences between most of the groups were statistically insignificant; however, the participants in the 70 decibels group — those exposed to a level of noise similar to background chatter in a coffee shop — significantly outperformed the other groups. Since the effects were small, this may suggest that our creative thinking does not differ that much in response to total silence and 85 decibels of background noise. \nBut since the results at 70 decibels were significant, the study also suggests that the right level of background noise — not too loud and not total silence — may actually improve one’s creative thinking ability. The right level of background noise may interrupt our normal patterns of thinking just enough to allow our imaginations to wander, without making it impossible to focus. This kind of “distracted focus” appears to be the best state for working on creative tasks. \nSo why do so many of us hate our open offices? The problem may be that, in our offices, we can’t stop ourselves from getting drawn into others’ conversations while we’re trying to focus. Indeed, the researchers found that face-to-face interactions and conversations affect the creative process, and yet a coworking space or a coffee shop provides a certain level of noise while also providing freedom from interruptions.\n32 Why does the interviewer prefer a coworking space?\nA. It helps him concentrate.\tB. It blocks out background noise.\nC. It has a pleasant atmosphere.\tD. It encourages face-to-face interactions.\n33.

Until I made a discovery.\nSouthbank, at an eastern bend in the Thames, is the center of British skateboarding, where the continuous crashing of skateboards left your head ringing .I loved it. I soon made friends with the local skaters. We spoke our own language. And my favorite: Safe. Safe meant cool. It meant hello. It meant don't worry about it. Once, when trying a certain trick on the beam（横杆）, I fell onto the stones, damaging a nerve in my hand, and Toby came over, helping me up: Safe, man. Safe. A few minutes later, when I landed the trick, my friends beat their boards loud, shouting: “ Safe! Safe!

His face is almost the international symbol for genius. But we want to go beyond one man and explore the nature of genius itself. Why is it that some people are so much more intelligent or creative than the rest of us? And who are they? \nIn the sciences and arts, those praised as geniuses were most often white men, of European origin. Perhaps this is not a surprise. It's said that history is written by the victors, and those victors set the standards for admission to the genius club. When contributions were made by geniuses outside the club—women, or people of a different color or belief—they were unacknowledged and rejected by others.\nA study recently published by Science found that as young as age six, girls are less likely than boys to say that members of their gender(性别)are “really, really smart.” Even worse, the study found that girls act on that belief: Around age six they start to avoid activities said to be for children who are “really, really smart.” Can our planet afford to have any great thinkers become discouraged and give up? It doesn't take a genius to know the answer: absolutely not.\nHere's the good news. In a wired world with constant global communication, we're all positioned to see flashes of genius wherever they appear. And the more we look, the more we will see that social factors(因素)like gender, race, and class do not determine the appearance of genius.

        "instruction": "B\nIn 1916, two girls of wealthy families, best friends from Auburn, N. Y.—Dorothy Woodruff and Rosamond Underwood—traveled to a settlement in the Rocky Mountains to teach in a one-room schoolhouse. The girls had gone to Smith College. They wore expensive clothes. So for them to move to Elkhead, Colo. to instruct the children whose shoes were held together with string was a surprise. Their stay in Elkhead is the subject of Nothing Daunted: The Unexpected Education of Two Society Girls in the West by Dorothy Wickenden, who is a magazine editor and Dorothy Woodruff’s granddaughter.\n Why did they go then? Well, they wanted to do something useful. Soon, however, they realized what they had undertaken.\nThey moved in with a local family, the Harrisons, and, like them, had little privacy, rare baths, and a blanket of snow on their quilt when they woke up in the morning. Some mornings, Rosamond and Dorothy would arrive at the schoolhouse to find the children weeping from the cold. In spring, the snow was replaced by mud over ice. \nIn Wickenden’s book, she expanded on the history of the West and also on feminism, which of course influenced the girls’ decision to go to Elkhead. A hair-raising section concerns the building of the railroads, which entailed (牵涉) drilling through the Rockies, often in blinding snowstorms. The book ends with Rosamond and Dorothy’s return to Auburn.\nWickenden is a very good storyteller. The sweep of the land and the stoicism (坚忍) of the people move her to some beautiful writing. Here is a picture of Dorothy Woodruff, on her horse, looking down from a hill top: “When the sun slipped behind the mountains, it shed a rosy glow all around them. Then a full moon rose. The snow was marked only by small animals: foxes, coyotes, mice, and varying hares, which turned white in the winter.” \n4. Why did Dorothy and Rosamond go to the Rocky Mountains?\nA. To teach in a school.\tB. To study American history.\nC. To write a book.\tD. To do sightseeing.\n5. What can we learn about the girls from paragraph 3?\nA. They enjoyed much respect.\tB. They had a room with a bathtub.\nCThey lived with the local kids.\tD. They suffered severe hardships.\n6. Which part of Wickenden’s writing is hair-raising?\nA. The extreme climate of Auburn.\tB. The living conditions in Elkhead.\nC. The railroad building in the Rockies.\tD. The natural beauty of the West.\n7. What is the text?\nA. A news report.\tB. A book review.\tC. A children’s story.\tD.

That is the very likely future of applying today’s “eyes in the sky” technology to making sure that the millions of kilometres of rail tracks and infrastructure(基础设施)worldwide are safe for trains on a 24/7 basis. \nDrones are already being used to examine high-tension electrical lines. They could do precisely the same thing to inspect railway lines and other vital aspects of rail infrastructure such as the correct position of railway tracks and switching points. The more regularly they can be inspected, the more railway safety, reliability and on-time performance will be improved. Costs would be cut and operations would be more efficient(高效)across the board. \nThat includes huge savings in maintenance costs and better protection of railway personnel safety. It is calculated that European railways alone spend approximately 20 billion euros a year on maintenance, including sending maintenance staff, often at night, to inspect and repair the rail infrastructure. That can be dangerous work that could be avoided with drones assisting the crews’ efforts. \nBy using the latest technologies, drones could also start providing higher-value services for railways, detecting faults in the rail or switches, before they can cause any safety problems. To perform these tasks, drones for rail don’t need to be flying overhead. Engineers are now working on a new concept: the rail drones of the future. They will be moving on the track ahead of the train, and programmed to run autonomously.

        "instruction": "D\nThe Government's sugar tax on soft drinks has brought in half as much money as Ministers first predicted it would generate, the first official data on the policy has shown. \nFirst announced in April, 2016, the tax which applies to soft drinks containing more than 5g of sugar per 100ml, was introduced to help reduce childhood obesity（肥胖）. It is believed that today's children and teenagers are consuming three times the recommended level of sugar, putting them at a higher risk of the disease. \nInitially the sugar tax was expected to make £520m a year for the Treasury. However, data of the first six months showed it would make less than half this amount. At present it is expected to generate £240m for the year ending in April 2019, which will go to school sports. \nIt comes after more than half of soft drinks sold in shops have had their sugar levels cut by manufacturers（制造商）so they can avoid paying the tax. Drinks now contain 45 million fewer kilos of sugar as a result of manufacturers' efforts to avoid the charge, according to Treasury figures. Since April drinks companies have been forced to pay between 18p and 24p for every litre of sugary drink they produce or import, depending on the sugar content. \nHowever, some high sugar brands, like Classic Coca Cola, have accepted the sugar tax and are refusing to change for fear of upsetting consumers. Fruit juices, milk-based drinks and most alcoholic drinks are free of the tax, as are small companies manufacturing fewer than 1m litres per year. \nToday's figures, according to one government official, show the positive influence the sugar tax is having by raising millions of pounds for sports facilities（设施）and healthier eating in schools. Helping the next generation to have a healthy and active childhood is of great importance, and the industry is playing its part. \n12. Why was the sugar tax introduced?\nA.

        "instruction": "D\nSometime in the early 1960s, a significant thing happened in Sydney, Australia. The city discovered its harbor. Then, one after another, Sydney discovered lots of things that were just sort of there — broad parks, superb beaches, and a culturally diverse population. But it is the harbor that makes the city.\nAndrew Reynolds, a cheerful fellow in his early 30s, pilots Sydney ferryboats for a living. I spent the whole morning shuttling back and forth across the harbor. After our third run Andrew shut down the engine, and we went our separate ways — he for a lunch break, I to explore the city.\n“I’ll miss these old boats,” he said as we parted.\n“How do you mean?” I asked.\n“Oh, they’re replacing them with catamarans. Catamarans are faster, but they’re not so elegant, and they’re not fun to pilot. But that’s progress, I guess.”\nEverywhere in Sydney these days, change and progress are the watchwords (口号), and traditions are increasingly rare. Shirley Fitzgerald, the city’s official historian, told me that in its rush to modernity in the 1970s, Sydney swept aside much of its past, including many of its finest buildings. “Sydney is confused about itself,” she said. “We can’t seem to make up our minds whether we want a modern city or a traditional one. It’s a conflict that we aren’t getting any better at resolving (解决).”\nOn the other hand, being young and old at the same time has its attractions. I considered this when I met a thoughtful young businessman named Anthony. “Many people say that we lack culture in this country,” he told me. “What people forget is that the Italians, when they came to Australia, brought 2000 years of their culture, the Greeks some 3000 years, and the Chinese more still. We’ve got a foundation built on ancient cultures but with a drive and dynamism of a young country. It’s a pretty hard combination to beat.”\nHe is right, but I can’t help wishing they would keep those old ferries.\n12. What is the first paragraph mainly about?\nA. Sydney’s striking architecture.\tB. The cultural diversity of Sydney.\nC. The key to Sydney’s development.\tD. Sydney’s tourist attractions in the 1960s.\n13. What can we learn about Andrew Reynolds?\nA. He goes to work by boat.\tB. He looks forward to a new life.\nC. He pilots catamarans well.\tD. He is attached to the old ferries.\n14.

The city discovered its harbor. (20世纪60年代初，澳大利亚悉尼发生了一件大事。这座城市发现了它的港口) ”以及“But it is the harbor that makes the city. (但是是港口造就了城市)”可知，本段主要介绍了悉尼发展的关键是港口。故选C项。\n【13题详解】\n细节理解题。根据第二段“Andrew Reynolds, a cheerful fellow in his early 30s, pilot Sydney ferryboats for a living.

(悉尼的官方历史学家Shirley Fitzgerald告诉我，在20世纪70年代奔向现代化的过程中，悉尼把很多它的过去都抛在了一边，包括许多最漂亮的建筑)”可推知，Shirley Fitzgerald认为悉尼匆忙奔向现代化，正在失去它的传统。故选A项。\n【15题详解】\n推理判断题。根据倒数第二段“On the other hand, being young and old at the same time has its attractions. I considered this when I met a thoughtful young businessman named Anthony.

He \n  was an international  grandmaster,  which   45  I would  be learning  from  one of the \ngame ’s   46  . I could  hardly  wait to 47  him. \nMaurice  Ashley  was kind and smart,  a former  graduate  returning  to teach,  and \nthis  48  was no game  for him: he meant  business.  In his introduction,  he made  it  \n49  that our credits  would  be hard-earned.  In order  to   50  the class,  among  other  \ncriteria,  we had to write  a paper  on how we plan to 51 what  we would  learn  in class  to \nour future  professions  and,   52  , to our lives.  I managed  to get an A in that   53  \nand learned  life lessons  that have  served  me well beyond  the  54  . \nTen years  after my chess  class  with Ashley,  I’m still putting  to use what  he 55 \nme: “The  absolute  most  important   56  that you learn  when  you play chess  is how \nto make  good   57  . On every  single  move  you have  to  58  a situation,  process  \nwhat  your opponent  (对手 ) is doing  and 59   the best move  from  among  all your \noptions.”  These  words  still ring true today  in my   60  as a journalist.  \n41.
